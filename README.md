# build-a-checkout-page-fcc
Build a checkout page in Freecodecamp.
## Thoughts:
This is a pretty good project where I got to think alot about how to organize and structure diffrent elements to fit well on the page. I realised that I didn't really know why I'd use sections or div but I think I understand now. Sections are used to categorize diffrent Sections of that includes multiple elements. while div is only to group one element or elements that are heavily related to the main element. Like having a input element and a label element going together and if you have all the paying credentials they should be structured within the section.

## Difficulty: 
Not that hard. Had a little difficulty understnading exacly where to put the span element as I had forgotten how to write it but with a simple google search I found that out.
